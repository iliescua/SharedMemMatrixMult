# SharedMemMatrixMult
This lab is an extension of the matrix multiplication lab where I made matrix multiplication a multi-process operation. This program contains an additional two methods which accomplish this same function; however, both implementations use shared memory (anonymous and named).
The execution time is again calculated using the system clock to display the efficncy of each implementation. 
Aditionally the matrix files are attached in the repository as well but custom ones can be used as long as they folow the same build format.
Comments are provided in the code to explain the thought process and function of key statements.
